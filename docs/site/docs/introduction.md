# Introduction

Nimbus is a framework for building <a href="{{ '/docs/progressive-hybrid-apps' | url }}">Progressive Hybrid Apps</a>. These apps take advantage of modern web standards in the browser and are enhanced with additional platform capabilities when running in a hybrid app container.

Nimbus can be integrated into an existing native or hybrid mobile application or used as a container for a fresh web project. See the _integration documentation_ for details.
