# Getting Started

Nimbus is highly flexible and supports a variety of integration models in order to cover a wide array of use cases. Choosing the right integration model for your app means deciding how Nimbus will integrate into your containing application and how Nimbus will integrate with your web app.

There are two ways to integrate Nimbus into your web app:

* Including the Nimbus runtime in your web app bundle (preferred)
* Injecting the Nimbus runtime when your web app is loaded in the hybrid container

Similarly in the containing application there are multiple ways to use Nimbus:

* Use Nimbus to create a hybrid container web view and load your app
* Attach Nimbus to your own web view
* Attach Nimbus to a web view from another hybrid framework
