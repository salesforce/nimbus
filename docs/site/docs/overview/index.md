# Introduction

Nimbus is a framework for building <a href="{{ '/docs/progressive-hybrid-apps' | url }}">Progressive Hybrid Apps</a>. These apps take advantage of modern web standards in the browser and are enhanced with additional platform capabilities when running in a hybrid app container.

Nimbus can be added to an existing native or hybrid mobile application to enhance its capabilities or used as a container for starting a fresh web project. Visit the <a href="{{ '/docs/overview/getting-started/' | url }}">Getting Started</a> page to learn how to begin using Nimbus.
