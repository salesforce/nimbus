# Nimbus for Apple Platforms

## Getting Started

The Nimbus project depends on some tools installed via [CocoaPods][]. To
bootstrap the installation first install [Bundler][], then use Bundler
to install the dependencies via CocoaPods:

```sh
gem install bundler
bundle install
bundle exec pod install
```

Once the dependencies are installed open `Nimbus.xcworkspace`.
